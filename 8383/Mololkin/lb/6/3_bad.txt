This was a great show. Season 1 was fantastic. My assumption is they hired a new woke writers room in season 2, who only took a few episodes to shoe-horn in the typical preaching agenda in the most on the nose way I've ever seen. You can tell how forced it is and that it wasn't the initial trajectory of the show. Incredibly disappointing, but unfortunately expected these days. It seems anything good picks up larger producers who enforce diversity requirements on writers rooms and then it's only a matter of time until we end up with another stale and cringy show awash with tired political tropes.
