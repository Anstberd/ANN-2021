Finally something new and fresh from the stereotypical drivel being jammed down our throats for the past couple of years. None of the clich√©s either. Dark,gory hilarious, ethically mind bending. Like how far would you twist justice to serve your needs, what price would you be willing to pay for revenge is it worth losing your humanity? All this mixed into a beautiful first season. Can't wait for more. A definite must watch epically if you enjoyed titles like Titans.
