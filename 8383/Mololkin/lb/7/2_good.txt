Every character is really complex and makes me wanna know more about them every time they are on the screen. Plus, there are a lot of storylines that advance during every episode and this gives the impression that the episodes are way longer than they really are and it never gets boring.
This show is a breath of fresh air from the classic superhero shows and movies, taking a totally different approach. Basically if superheroes existed in real life but with the bad traits of the humans.
