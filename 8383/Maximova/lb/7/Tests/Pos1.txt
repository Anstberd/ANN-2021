Several days ago I watched a British crime thriller the Legend. Brian Helgeland is the scriptwriter and the director of the film as well. It is adapted from a book The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins which is based on a real story.
The film tells about the life of twin brothers, Reggie and Ronnie Kray, who were violent and vulgar gangsters. They also were iconic figures in the criminal environment of London in 1960s. They headed the most influential gang of bandits of the East-End.
They strongarmed, attempted assassination and killed several crime bosses. They also owned a nightclub where came even Hollywood stars. However, it is not easy to be a criminal and it is impossible to give up the crime. It destroyed their lives and they both ended in jail and died alone having lost everything they had and loved.
The film is very fascinating and it is a pleasure to watch it even if the plot is rather cruel and heavy. Each part of the movie completes the picture. When you watch it, you dig into the atmosphere by means of sounds, music, costumes, and decorations.
Everything is well-orchestrated and the actor that plays the main role is extremely talented. Tom Hardy plays both brothers which have absolutely different characters and personalities. And Hardy acts fantastically!
The Legend is definitely one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It can win all hearts!
