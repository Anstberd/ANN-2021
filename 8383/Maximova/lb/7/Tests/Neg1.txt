As they say, why did I start watching this movie ?! However, the name "Hotel of Psychopaths" ... as they say, he knew what he was doing. It's just awful. By the way, in terms of genre, it is classified as a horror, although this is just a film about a mentally ill man who invited different people to the hotel supposedly for an unforgettable weekend, and he himself "started his game."
Shooting is disgusting, low-budget. Acting, well, it's not even a student circle. Funny, among them was Eric Roberts, brother you know who. But the game ... Dialogues from the category: (everyone is half-bloody on the floor) "- Honey, are you pregnant? - Yes, honey. - This is great, I hope after my death, you will be happy again. - Honey, do not die! - No , I'm dying!" Well, at the end, the theatrical closing of the eyes, apparently means that his hero has outlived his life.
In general, there is no sanity in the film at all. You look at the behavior of the heroes and it seems that there are absolutely no normal ones there. Perhaps because of a similar acting. And what are the silent grimaces and strained reduction of eyebrows and wrinkles on the forehead of a former psychotherapist.
We watched and it all seemed, well, it couldn't be that there was such a movie. And the director could. And the actors did it.
