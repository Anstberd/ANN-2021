Tries to tackle racism head-on & in a raw, brutal way. But ends up treating the audience like juvenile idiots. Cheesy operatic music (screams: look at me, I'm a cool art house movie! This is meant to be a dramatic scene!) & pointless usage of slow-mo shots. Characters are caricatures. Derek Vinyard's sweeping shift from hardcore skinhead to reformed man is unrealistic & almost comical.
