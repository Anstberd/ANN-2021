Not an exploration of the racial divide for the modern era; there is far too much prominently displayed nazi paraphernalia, and far too many white people yelling the n-word for an explicitly stated thesis of "hate is bad." It's hard to take Edward Norton's Derek Vinyard seriously as we move back and forth between his portrayals of a bright-eyed high-schooler, a murderous skin-head, and a hardened ex-con. The core narrative is simple, but the film is over-ambitious in its execution. The characters mostly fall flat, which makes it difficult to take their grappling with extremism seriously. The use of black and white is far too on the nose, and embodies the simplemindedness with which this complex subject matter is handled.
