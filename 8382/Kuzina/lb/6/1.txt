Lindsay Lohan is accomplished in the dual role of twins separated at birth who meet when they're 11—and contrive to reunite their divorced parents. But the process takes more than two hours, during which seemingly inconsequential details—like the fact that the twins' mother designs bridal gowns—are obtrusively emphasized so their significance can be revealed later. A remake of the 1961 movie, which was based on a story by Erich Kästner, this 1998 romantic comedy is mostly boring with its cumbersome exposition and close-ups of trivial objects scattered throughout lackluster montage sequences.
