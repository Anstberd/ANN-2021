More than Lucas, I admire only the everlasting composer John Williams. Iâ€™m just wondering where he gets his ideas for each composition. For a minute he not only composed all the music for these films, but also for Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Schindler's List, Jaws, and each of his soundtracks is magical. This film is no exception, as Star Wars is famous for its recognizable music. In addition to the famous screensaver and the Imperial March, they are brilliant: a funeral on Naboo, a march of clones, a battle between a student and a teacher, a great extermination. Star Wars music can be used like the works of Mozart and Chopin, the effect is the same.
