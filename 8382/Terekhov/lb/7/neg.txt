It is interesting that everyone pays attention to bloopers, bad acting, inconsistencies with subsequent films, but for some reason no one pays attention to ethics.
This is awful! Indescribable by any words! How can people even tolerate this? Moreover, they also like it for some reason.
Here revenge and betrayal awaits us even worse than in Game of Thrones. The film is called Revenge of the Sith, although it should be called Revenge of the Jedi or Revenge of Obi-Wan - although for what, it is not clear.
The most disgusting thing about this film is that the dismemberment and burning of your friends here is shown as moral.
Yes, the most notorious villains in other films do not behave the way 'heroes' behave here.
