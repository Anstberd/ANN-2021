In the bins of your sideboards, for sure, there are plates from the service bought once by your grandmother or even great-grandmother. The plates do not fit the rest of your dishes at all, and by rearranging them from place to place when cleaning, you annoy yourself that you cannot have the courage to throw out unnecessary trash.
Now imagine that these plates are the only thing that connects you to the past. With parents, childhood, home. A home that no longer exists and most likely never will.
Fern and her husband lived in the small town of Empire. There was nothing remarkable about it - only one drywall factory, around which the city grew. But during the crisis, the company went bankrupt, Fern's husband died of an illness, and the woman was suddenly left without a home, without a job and a livelihood.
Fern has no choice but to load a few things dear to his heart in the car and hit the road. A path that has no destination.
On the way, she will meet many people - good and different. She will go through difficult trials and discover new truths. And we will watch this calm, unhurried, somewhere philosophical action without any action, special effects and drama. I can't take my eyes off.
It would seem that the American theme of the film will surely find a response in the heart of the domestic audience to the tips of the nails. And we have many small towns with one city-forming enterprise, the closure of which means the collapse of life, at least the old one. But the mentality and fear of the future will not allow most of us to go so boldly towards the new and unknown. And this is more bad than good, in my opinion.
The film is just great. It allows you to think about a lot, and - to look differently at seemingly familiar things, people who are circling. Learn to appreciate them a little more.
