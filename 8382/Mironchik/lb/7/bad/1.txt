Like a movie, 'Crimea' is a lazy, clumsy hack. From the point of view of shooting, everything is bad: the scale of events in Ukraine is not felt because of about 10 locations for the entire film, the camera angles are as banal and inventive as possible, as if a first-year journalist was filming. The editor in his skills did not go far from the operator: the transition between scenes is carried out only by darkening, color correction in different scenes, sometimes even at the same location, is not combined with each other, and the frame is flat separately, as if the frame was not painted at all. The director's disregard is clearly seen in the ridiculous scene with the attack of the revolutionaries on the Berkut and in the choreography of the battle in general. The writers lazily prescribed the heroes of the film, sometimes without giving motivation for the actions shown in the film, a huge number of plot holes and illogicalities, and the dialogues were written by the forty-year-old loader Vasily, there are so many cliches that can be found in the federal media. As a result, the actors do not know who to play and do their job poorly. A waste of money for ordinary citizens who want to see a movie.
